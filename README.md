# HabitLogger
Console based application to track your progress in habits per day. Developed using C# and SQLite.
# Given Requirements:
- [x] This is an application where you’ll register one habit.
- [x] This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)
- [x] The application should store and retrieve data from a real database
- [x] When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
- [x] It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
- [x] The app should show the user a menu of options.
- [x] The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
- [x] You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
- [x] The application should only be terminated when the user inserts 0.
- [x] You can only interact with the database using raw SQL. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework.
- [x] Your project needs to contain a Read Me file where you'll explain how your app works. Here's a nice example:
